# A formal model of mood instability

## Introduction 
This repository includes code on a model that formalizes mood instability using the computational process of (reference-based) evaluation: that is, the evaluation of stimuli (humans, objects, events) based on a comparative frame of reference (see Zavlis, Bentall, Fonagy, and Rigoli, 2024). This model has its origins in traditional cognitive theories, which converged on the idea that our evaluation of stimuli is typically based on a comparative frame of reference. (For example, according to Kahneman & Tversky's infamous prospect theory, how a person evaluates a pay raise depends on what reference they use. If they use their current salary as a reference, they will probably feel elated. However, if they use an expectation of a higher salary as a reference, they might be indifferent.) 

In our paper, we argued that this process of evaluation can be used to explain the elusive psychological concept of ''mood instability''. Mood instability is found in virtually all psychopathologies, so creating a mathematical theory that explains it may enable clinicians (and sufferers alike) to better understand and thereby treat it.
